\subsection{Parallelization in SbS networks}
SbS network models are constructed in sequential layered structures, each layer consists of many IPs which can be simulated independently while the communication between the IPs is organized by a low bandwidth signal -- the spikes \cite{Rotermund500280}. Technically, each IP is an independent computational entity (see \fig{fig:SbS_layer}), this allows to design specialized hardware architectures that can be massively parallelized.
