\subsection{Conv2D tensor operation}
The \emph{Conv2D} tensor operation is described in \Equ{eq:conv2D}. Where $X$ represents the input feature maps, $W$ represents the convolution kernel (known as filter) and $b$ represents the bias for the output feature maps\cite{goodfellow2016deep}.

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:conv2D}
Conv\left(W,X\right)_{i,j,o}=\sum_{k,l,m}^{K,L,M}W_{(o,k,l,m)} \cdot X_{(i+k,j+l,m)}+b_{o}
\end{eqnarray} 	
 	
\subsection{DepthwiseConv2D tensor operation}
The \emph{DepthwiseConv2D} tensor operation is described in \Equ{eq:dconv2D}. Where $X$ represents the input feature maps, $W$ represents the convolution kernel (known as filter), and $b$ represents the bias for the output feature maps.

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:dconv2D}
DConv\left(W,X\right)_{i,j,n}=\sum_{k,l}^{K,L}W_{(k,l,n)} \cdot X_{(i+k,j+l,n)}+b_{n}
\end{eqnarray}
